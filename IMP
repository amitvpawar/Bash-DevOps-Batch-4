Condition && Command1 || Command2

In this case if the Condition is True then Command1 will execute but if Condtion is False then it will execute Command2.
Example1:-
I have "hello.txt" file exists

[ -f hello.txt ] && echo Present || echo Not Exists

This command gives you Result as "Present"
Example2:
"Hello.txt" file does not exists

[ -f Hello.txt ] && echo Present || echo Not Exists

This command gives you Result as "Not Exists"
If the Condition is True(Exist status zero) then Command1 will execute but if the Command1
False(Exit status non zero) then Command2 also will get execute.

Example3:
[ -f hello.txt ] && [ -f Hello.txt ] || echo "hello.txt present still executed"
 
This command gives Result as "hello.txt present still executed"
Reason:- as Hello.txt not present gives Exit status non zero.

OR
[ -f hello.txt ] && ech prsent || echo "hello.txt present still executed"

In Command1 gives error as "ech" not an command
